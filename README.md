# BCS Lv 4 BootCamp - Project 8 - FullStack Tech Blog Application

## Description
This is a complete full-stack blogging platform, that allows users to register, log-in, and manage their own content. The application supports creating, updating and deleting blog posts, filtering posts by category, and viewing posts dynamically. It is built with a Node.js/Express backend, connected to a MySQL database via Squelize, and a Bootstrap-styled frontend that interacts with the API. The project is deployed on Render for real-world accessibility.
